Today, we gather here to celebrate a day of immense pride and historic significance—Pakistan’s National Day. On this very date in 1940, our forefathers adopted the historic Lahore Resolution, affirming their unwavering resolve for an independent homeland. Their courage, vision, and sacrifice laid the very foundation upon which Pakistan stands today.
